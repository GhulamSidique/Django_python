Django
View: there are two types of views. the function based and the class based view.
1. Function based view:
a function that takes web request and redturns a web response.
syntax:
def function(request):
	return HttpResponse('htm'/'variable' etc)

we will write the view code in the view.py file of the application
after that we have to define the url name of this function in the projetsc url.py file 
we have to import the HttpResponse from django.http module

Create a view syntax complete
create a project==> django_admin startproject name
create an application ==> python manage.py startapp name
open settings file and add application name there
open views file and write above syntax of view
open url and add view there by importing view from application name
now the views are created and we can run them by inserting the http port number
https:....../name of view1
https:....../name of view2
and so on....
